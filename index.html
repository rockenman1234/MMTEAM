                We're Team #34, a dynamic group of
                five Georgia Tech students collaborating on an exciting
                second project as part of GT-2340. Our team consists of four
                Computer Science majors and one Computer Engineering major,
                bringing together a diverse range of skills in software
                development, system architecture, and problem-solving.

                Our websites are built using TailWindCSS.com to
                provide an interactive, user-friendly, and fast experience! We’ve
                integrated the Spotify API directly to offer a detailed and
                output while avoiding issues occuring from recent changes in Spotify's API. 
                We also used Figma to design a basic website, and Trello+Teams for asynchronous communication and collaboration.

                TO DO:
                <br>
                - Add a video demo of the project.

                    projects and experiences. For the MelodyMixer project, I served as the full
                    stack developer, Scrum master, and Product Owner. My job was
                    to quickly set up the entire application's framework, allowing the
                    rest of the team to build out the necessary features as needed. I also worked on resolving
                    merge conflicts, implementating bug fixes, managing our timeline, and addressing communication challenges between team members.
